# **Beetles-Tracker**

## **Summary of the project:**

This is the Project for AI coding challenge, written in Python and OpenCV.
It can integrates several algorithms to identify beetles in the image datasets. 
A sliding window method is used to calculate the correlation value for each 20 x 20 image patch in the test image.
The first algorithm is using the color histogram of sample beetles as template and calculating the correlation 
coefficient of color histogram between sample beetles and test image patch. 
The second algorithm is calculating the circular variance of orientation tuning curve for each image patch. The
higher the circular variance is, the more likely it's corresponding to a beetle.
The correlation value for each image patch is calculated as the multiplication of correlation coefficient and 
circular variance.
The correlation map is thresholded to identify possible beetles.

## **Requirement**

This program requires Python 2.7 and OpenCV 3.0

## **Features**
* calculate the color histogram for the sample beetles
* use the sliding window method to calculate the correlation coefficient of color histogram between each
test image patch and sample beetles
* calculate the circular variance (CV) for each test image patch, the higher CV is the more likely it's a beetle 
* calculate the correlation map as the multiplication of correlation coefficient and circular variance
* calculate the correlation map for each test image and highlight the identified beetles

## **Color Histogram**

#### **color histogram of sample beetles**

Five beetles are used as sample to calculate the true color histogram. The template is used to calculate the 
correlation coefficient for each test image patch.

#### **color histogram of background**

An example of color histogram for background is plotted to facilitate comparison with the template color histogram.
The color histogram for background is different from that of template.

## **Circular Variance**

#### **beetles have striped pattern**

To facilitate comparison, two image patches are drawn. Image on the left corresponds to beetle. We can see clear 
striped pattern. Image on the right is background. We can see that although they share similar color histogram, 
their patterns are very different from each other.

#### **beetles have higher circular variance**

The local gradient is calculated for each image patch. To facilitate comparison, I put them side by side. The images
on the left correspond to beetle and the images on the right correspond to the background. The upper images correspond
to the angles of gradient map and lower images correspond to the orientation tuning curve of each each angle map. We
can see that the striped pattern is reserved for the beetle image, but not for the background image. Reflected on the
orientation tuning curve, we can see two obvious peaks 180 degrees part from each other for the beetle's gradient
angle map, but not for the background orientation tuning curve. The circular variance is used to measure the peakness
of orientation tuning map.

## **Correlation map and Result**

#### **correlation map**

Correlation map is calculated as the multiplication of correlation coefficient and circular variance. A correlation 
value is assigned to each test image patch. In the given example correlation map, we can clearly see a significantly
brighter region in the center of the image.

#### **result**

The correlation map is thresholded to identify the possible beetle. The identified beetle is cropped by a red box.

The original test image is also shown to facilitate comparison.
